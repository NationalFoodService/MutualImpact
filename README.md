This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Mutual Impact ðŸ“ˆ

## Intro

A react web application, in the early stages of development, that will allow users to log impact and contributions to community projects. Eventually the goal is to implement a currency or system that enables bodies and funders to more easily support communities in relation to the people they have helped.

The project is under development as part of the National Food Service, grassroots community projects in solidarity across the UK.
