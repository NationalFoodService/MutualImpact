## Intro

A react web application, in the early stages of development, that will allow users to log impact and contributions to community projects. Eventually the goal is to implement a currency or system that enables bodies and funders to more easily support communities in relation to the people they have helped.

The project is under development at Foodhall, a grassroots community project based in Sheffield.
