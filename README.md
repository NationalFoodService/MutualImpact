# Hours

Hours is a time-based currency project under development at Foodhall in Sheffield. The goal is to, eventually, have a decentralised system for distributing a currency based on hours contributed to the community and be able to exchange those for services and goods from the community.

This repository will serve be used for the development of a frontend interface for this system.
